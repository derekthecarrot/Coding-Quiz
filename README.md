# Coding Quiz

## Description
Hello, I built this coding quiz in order to seek improvement on my Javascript. My biggest challenge still seems to be stepping through the code. It seems hard to properly evaluate when what needs to be done. Debugging and learning whats wrong (for it to only be a quotation mark or parenthesis is also a struggle). I overcame these issues with patience and time, and just kept working on what could be happening through my functions.

## Credits

I used several youtube videos and attempted to adapt them to what I needed as well as conferring with my peers to figure out a solution for this.
